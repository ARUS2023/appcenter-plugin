# AppCenter Plugin

Jenkins plugin to upload artefacts to AppCenter. A replacement for the [HockeyApp](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hockeyapp) plugin.

## Roadmap

This plugin is currently in Alpha and looking for contributors. To begin with it will aim to support the upload functionality of AppCenter. When the APIs for AppCenter become stable this plugin will be eligible to be moved out of Alpha.

Upcoming functionality:

1. Specify release notes.
2. More unit tests.
